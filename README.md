## Technologies Used to Create Day-By-Day
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* Moment.JS

## Early Steps

I began by acquainting myself with Moment.JS and practicing with it as well as Jquery with some simple exercises and console.log experiments. 

## Lessons In Coding

After getting my MVP set up and deployed, I worked on fine-tuning the code and add a couple features I had in mind. This process helped me familiarize myself with building html elements on the fly with JavaScript/Jquery. Several fun logic problems to work through, especially with the bonus items like clearing the calendar each day and setting the sliding clock.

**Updating colors**

- Getting used to Moment.JS was the biggest hurdle here. My early attempts had a lot of confusing and unnecessary code. My late iterations including dynamically updating colors without need for refresh.

**Saving the plan**

- This was a great opportunity to reinforce what I learned in the last homework assignment with regards to local storage.

**Mobile First design**

- Using the BootStrap framework helps make the design and final product a mobile friendly app from the beginning.
